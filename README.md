# gt-autotask

## Known issues
- No automation exists for the Multiple active sessions warning message. This requires manual intervention to click through the AutoTask warning message.
- If a Ticket or Task status doesn't allow time to be entered the 'New Time'?? button is not enabled and the workflow gets stuck




## Limitations
The following limiations are included by design
- No delete actions are performed.  A deviation from this is when a Task is updated in the Week entry view.
- Timesheets are not automatically submitted. It is your responsbility to confirm time is captured correctly.
